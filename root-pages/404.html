            <h3><a href="https://modjeska.us">Homepage</a></h3>
            <p>Jeremy's internet website. It's mostly some code you don't need and pictures of bicycles. But check it out.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://modjeska.us/contract-law-flow-chart/">Contract Law Flowchart</a></h3>
            <p>Are you sure you should be using this? I mean, I'm just a ding-dong who took a business law course a long time ago. <a href="https://i.modjeska.us/2011/04/Contract-Law-Flowchart.pdf">But here's the flowchart PDF you were probably linked to</a>.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://modjeska.us/project-style-wbs-numbering-in-ms-excel/">Project-Style WBS Numbering in Excel</a></h3>
            <p>A long time ago this is how the wooly mammoths and the giant sabre-toothed megasloths organized information. <a href="https://i.modjeska.us/2009/03/wbs_numbering.xlsm.zip">But here's the example spreadsheet you were probably trying to download</a>.</p>

            <h3>Can't find it?</h3>
            <p>I've moved things around recently. If something is broken or missing, let me know by <a href="https://github.com/jmodjeska/modjeska.us/issues">opening an issue on Github</a>. Or email me: jeremy+404@modjeska.us.</p>
