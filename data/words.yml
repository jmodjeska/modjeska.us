      <p>During these times of great stress and mandatory quarantine, we need live music more than ever. And while videoconference apps are the new normal for staying in touch, they are optimized for the kind of low-quality audio that business people need when they&rsquo;re talking about business in their business meetings. With a little work, though, you can unlock the full potential of your VC app and make your live music sound good to your remote listeners. Here are some tips for configuring <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> for a live music event.</p>
      <p><em><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I don&rsquo;t work for Zoom and I am in no way qualified to give musical advice to anyone. These are suggestions based on experimentation. Your mileage may vary. No musicians were harmed in the making of this post.</em></p>

      <h2>General Advice</h2>

      <ol class="bignum">
        <li><span aria-label="1">1.</span>
          <p><strong>Use Zoom Pro</strong>. Your show will probably exceed 40 minutes, and you&rsquo;ll want to record it, and you&rsquo;ll want some of the advanced settings below. All of those depend on a non-free version of Zoom. You may already have a Zoom Business account, and since Zoom accounts incur a flat monthly rate, your company may not mind your using it for personal endeavors like bringing beautiful music to your friends and family. Of course, responsible corporate citizens will want to check with their IT team before they use a company Zoom account for personal meetings.</p>
        </li>
        <li><span aria-label="2">2.</span>
          <p><strong>Have a single source of music</strong>. Latency is unpredictable and varies by participant, so it&rsquo;s unlikely that you can pull off a coordinated performance with multiple Zoom participants playing music simultaneously. A single source of music is your best bet.</p>
        </li>
        <li><span aria-label="3">3.</span>
          <p><strong>Use a stereo line out for the music / performers</strong>. Don&rsquo;t rely on the built-in microphone on a laptop, tablet, or phone to transmit quality audio. The music source should be a stereo line out from a sound board (or whatever you kids use to mix music these days). Optionally, the musician(s) can also Zoom in from a secondary device when they want to take a break and casually chat with other attendees.</p>
        </li>
        <li><span aria-label="4">4.</span>
          <p><strong>Do a sound check with a remote participant</strong>. Before you perform in front of your masses of fans, friends, mom, etc., experiment with all of the settings described below to dial-in your perfect audio configuration prior to the show. Take detailed notes as you discover the optimal settings because musicians drink a lot and they won&rsquo;t remember all of the configuration steps on the day of the show.</p>
        </li>
        <li><span aria-label="5">5.</span>
          <p><strong>Have a non-performer (co-)host the meeting</strong>. Throughout the beautiful performance, people will insist on unmuting themselves and making irritating noises (e.g., &ldquo;singing along&rdquo;). To maximize the audio quality of the music, and minimize interruptions during the performance, a designated host or co-host can mute and unmute all non-performer guests at appropriate times. Don&rsquo;t expect the musicians to do this; they will be preoccupied with making music. And drinking.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Host Configuration</h2>

      <p>As the Zoom meeting owner, you will need to preconfigure some settings in your Zoom account. Follow these steps <em>before</em> you create the Zoom meeting.</p>
      <h3>Enable stereo</h3>
      <p>As the host, you must allow your participants to enable stereo sound. To do that, login to your Zoom account in a browser (not the app) and navigate to <strong><em>Settings &gt; In Meeting (Advanced)</em></strong>. Enable <strong><em>Allow users to select stereo audio in their client settings</em></strong>. (<a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115004830406-Enabling-stereo-audio">Zoom help for Enabling Stereo</a>)</p>
      <h3>Enable original sound</h3>
      <p>This is the most important setting. As the host, you have to explicitly enable this (and then some more complicated shit happens later in the Musician configuration detailed below). As above, login to your Zoom account in a browser (not the app) and navigate to <strong><em>Settings &gt; In Meeting (Advanced)</em></strong>. Enable the option for <strong><em>Allow users to select original sound in their client settings.</em></strong> (<a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115003279466-Preserve-original-sound">Zoom help for Original Sound</a>)</p>
      <figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i.modjeska.us/images/zoom-music/zoom-stereo-original-sound.png" alt=""></figure>
      <h3>Mute participants on entry</h3>
      <p>This will help prevent disruptions in the middle of a performance. Per General Advice above, make sure a designated (co-)host can also <em>unmute</em> participants at appropriate times. Protip: people will turn on you quickly you if you forget to unmute them. (<a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005759423-Managing-participants-in-a-meeting">Zoom help for Managing Participants</a>)</p>
      <figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i.modjeska.us/images/zoom-music/zoom-mute-on-entry.png" alt=""></figure>

      <h2>Musician Configuration</h2>

      <p>The first three items below are essential. The rest are variables you can experiment with during sound check.</p>

      <h3>Join the Zoom from the Mac or PC Zoom app</h3>

      <p>As the performer, don&rsquo;t try to use a tablet or phone because you won&rsquo;t have access to the advanced options that are needed to optimize your audio.</p>

      <h3>Enable stereo</h3>

      <p>After joining the Zoom, you&rsquo;ll find this setting in your Zoom app under <strong><em>Audio (bottom left) &gt; Audio Settings &gt; Enable Stereo.</em></strong></p>
      <figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i.modjeska.us/images/zoom-music/zoom-enable-stereo.png" alt=""></figure>

      <h3>Enable original sound</h3>

      <p>This one is complicated, but stay with me because it&rsquo;s the most important step. After you join the Zoom on your Mac or PC, in your main Zoom window, click on <strong><em>Audio (bottom left) &gt; Audio Settings &gt; Advanced</em></strong>. Check the box for <strong><em>Show in-meeting option to &lsquo;Enable Original Sound&rsquo; from microphone.</em></strong> </p>
      <figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i.modjeska.us/images/zoom-music/zoom-audio-advanced.png" alt=""></figure>
      <figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i.modjeska.us/images/zoom-music/zoom-advanced-enable-original.png" alt=""></figure>
      <p>With that setting enabled, close the settings window, and, back in your main Zoom window, look for <strong><em>Turn on original sound</em></strong> in the top left. Click on that to enable original sound (when it says <em>Turn off original sound,</em> you&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s turned on). </p>
      <figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i.modjeska.us/images/zoom-music/zoom-turn-on-original.png" alt=""></figure>

      <h3>Experiment with background noise suppression</h3>

      <p>During sound check, <em>after</em> completing the above steps, have your remote sound-checker evaluate whether you sound better with the following settings enabled or disabled (my suggestion: disable both). </p>
      <p><strong><em>Audio (bottom left) &gt; Audio Settings &gt; Suppress Persistent Background Noise.</em></strong> </p>
      <p><strong><em>Audio (bottom left) &gt; Audio Settings &gt; Suppress Intermittent Background Noise.</em></strong> </p>
      <figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://i.modjeska.us/images/zoom-music/zoom-suppressions.png" alt=""><figcaption><br></figcaption></figure>

      <h2>Participant (Listener) Configuration</h2>

      <p>Host: share these recommendations with your listener attendees.</p>

      <h3>Enable stereo</h3>

      <p>After joining the Zoom, you&rsquo;ll find this setting in your Zoom app under <strong><em>Audio (bottom left) &gt; Audio Settings &gt; Enable Stereo.</em></strong></p>

      <h3>Mute yourself when people are playing music</h3>

      <p>Even in the fake dream world where you have perfect pitch, latency will still ruin your singalong. Don&rsquo;t subject your friends to that; mute while the musicians are performing.</p>

      <h3>Connect to a decent sound system</h3>

      <p>If your musician friends have correctly configured their audio settings, then they have unlocked your ability to enjoy their performance at its fullest potential. It&rsquo;s your responsibility now to maximize the presence and authenticity of their sound. Your laptop, tablet, or phone speakers won&rsquo;t rise to this challenge. If a decent stereo system is at your disposal &mdash; via airplay, hard wire, etc. &mdash; you&rsquo;ll enjoy the show appreciably more if you connect your device to a boss system.</p>

      <p><em>The <strong>G.R.E.A.T. Decision Making model</strong> describes five essential ingredients to equip decision-makers for success. It is a recipe for empowering rising leaders with more authority and for driving efficiency in a growing organization.</em></p>
      <p>In a startup&rsquo;s early stages, decision-making is concentrated with a small team &mdash; usually founders and their closely-knit and highly-motivated early hires. Well-informed, timely, and savvy decisions during these nascent days are crucial for the business&rsquo;s survival. But as the organization grows, communication channels increase exponentially, and suddenly our expert decision-makers find themselves removed &mdash; physically and temporally &mdash; from day-to-day decisions.</p>
      <p>At this stage, if our founding heroes are the only ones with the tools to make wise decisions for the business, then bad things start to happen. Bottlenecks form, delaying action and hindering the organization&rsquo;s efficiency and (ironically) its growth. Cultural costs also accrue in the form of disempowerment among managers and individual contributors, real or perceived lack of trust from leadership, and barriers to career development.</p>
      <p>The G.R.E.A.T. Decision Making model describes five essential ingredients to equip decision-makers for success:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Guardrails</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Resources</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Expectations</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Accountability</strong></li>

For both of our companies, the rapid shift to remote internships beginning in 2020 was a major adjustment for everyone involved.</p>
      <p>I partnered with Smartsheet&rsquo;s University Programs Manager Lauren Houk to dive into what we&rsquo;ve collectively learned. In this article, we share context on why internships matter, the challenges of moving from in-person to remote internships, and the solutions we&rsquo;ve discovered.</p>

      <p>Organizational process design is paramount to successful leadership. Intentional or not, we construct and model the communication frameworks that govern the way our teams make decisions. Ideally, we approach this responsibility deliberately, establishing processes that empower where empowerment matters; that safeguard where boundaries are called for; that flex and harden and stretch; that encourage outcomes consistent with our guiding principles. Inevitably, the processes we adopt won&rsquo;t just guide our decisions &mdash; in tangible ways, the processes are the decisions.</p>
      <p>In a growing company, two business-critical examples of where process-as-decision has lasting and material consequences are hiring and product development. In this article I wrote for Highspot, I briefly explain why and encourage greater appreciation for the significance of value-driven, intentional process design.</p>

      <p>Partnering with socially-conscious coding bootcamps for your internship program can form the foundation of your diversity initiative and provide access to engineering careers for traditionally underrepresented groups. Are these internships right for your company, and are you adequately prepared to host an intern?</p>
      <p>A software engineering internship is a formative experience for a coding bootcamp graduate. Internships bridge the bootcamp&rsquo;s abbreviated technical curriculum with an entry-level developer job. And because bootcamps actively recruit and graduate women, minorities, and other groups underrepresented in tech at much higher rates than universities do, providing internship opportunities for these graduates is an important lever in closing the gender gap and diversifying our shared candidate pool. Internship programs, furthermore, bring significant value to your team, your company&rsquo;s culture, and your recruiting efforts.</p>
      <p>But internships aren&rsquo;t free&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;they require investment, particularly in your company culture&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;and they aren&rsquo;t right for every team at every moment. In this article, I&rsquo;ll explore some key considerations that hiring managers and company leaders should account for when building an internship program that caters to coding bootcamp graduates.</p>

      <p>I spend a lot of time advocating for and worrying about the future of cycling in Seattle. Despite the gradually-improving bike infrastructure here, and the growing adoption of cycling as a way of life, we&rsquo;re still a car-centric city where riders are largely unseen by drivers and bike facilities are a funding afterthought.</p>
      <p>On a recent <a href="https://modjeska.us/pictures-china-2014/" title="China 2014 Pictures">tour through Yunnan province in China</a>, I saw what cycling looks like as a way of life. Cycling doesn&rsquo;t belong to hipsters or exercise fanatics. Everyone does it, and it&rsquo;s so deeply integrated into every aspect of society that most people don&rsquo;t give it a second thought.</p>
      <p>People use their bikes &mdash; often bikes so old they&rsquo;d be given away for free on Craigslist here &mdash; to carry merchandise, trash, construction materials, supplies, groceries, and other people.</p>
      <p>Everywhere, merchants setup shop in expansive outdoor markets, and bikes are their transportation and cargo vehicles.</p>
      <p>In Kunming, whose urban population is double that of Seattle yet still only moderately-large by China standards, bikes are ubiquitous as commuter vehicles, and the most logical way to transport materials within and between businesses and public places.</p>
      <p>Kunming has its own Greenlake Park (&#32736;&#28246;&#20844;&#22253;). But you won&rsquo;t see rollerbladers and double-wide strollers there. You&rsquo;ll see people doing Tai-Chi, and bikes of all flavors.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The Privilege of the Writ: The Supreme Court and Post-9/11 Detainee Habeas Corpus Entitlement&rdquo; is a paper I wrote in 2010. In some ways it is a follow-up to my 2009 <em>Kiyemba</em> posts, <a href="https://modjeska.us/kiyemba-v-obama-part-i/">Parts I</a> and <a href="/kiyemba-v-obama-part-ii/">II</a>. But mainly it&rsquo;s a survey of Habeas Corpus law before and after 9/11. The full paper can be <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1672941">accessed on SSRN</a>.</p>
      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>Habeas corpus is the right to challenge one&rsquo;s detention in a court of law. Prior to 9/11, habeas corpus jurisprudence erected a framework of entitlements that vary according to a person&rsquo;s location, citizenship, and alleged crimes. Plotted on a timeline of American history, many of the landmark cases that progressively articulated this framework are clustered around wartime, and the entitlement conventions that obtained reflected the terminology of traditional warfare. After 9/11, as the nature of warfare and enemies evolved, and the Executive claimed unprecedented authority to detain enemy combatants, Guantanamo Bay became the extraterritorial detention facility of choice. Beginning in 2004, the Supreme Court responded with a series of cases that created a minimal but definite foundation of habeas corpus entitlement and due process for Guantanamo detainees. This article looks primarily at these post-9/11 cases, the traditional notions of habeas corpus upon which they are predicated, and the possible shortcomings they evidence relative to Guantanamo and to other extraterritorial detention facilities.

      <p><em>The Guantanamo detainee case Kiyemba v. Obama is a potentially landmark separation-of-powers case headed for the US Supreme Court in March 2010, with major policy issues and the futures of 13 detainees at stake. In this two-part story, I examine the case&rsquo;s background and some questions it raises. This is a follow-up to <a href="/kiyemba-v-obama-part-i">Part I: Jamal Kiyemba&rsquo;s long journey home</a>.<br>
      </em></p>

      <h2>Part II: New borders</h2>
      <p>Judge A. Raymond Randolph <a href="#kiyemba_ii_sources">wrote</a> for the majority:</p>

      <blockquote><p>Seventeen Chinese citizens currently held at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, brought petitions for writs of habeas corpus. &hellip; The question is whether [they] are entitled to an order requiring the [US] government to bring them to the United States and release them here.</p></blockquote>

      <p>This opening paragraph of the decision by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals in February of 2009 introduced a document that dramatically altered the fate of those seventeen men. The men had previously been ordered by a lower court to be freed inside the United States, but the Executive branch appealed, saying the lower court had no such authority. Subsequently, the question that Judge Randolph introduced above was answered: no. No, the seventeen men will not be released into the United States, and unlike Jamal Kiyemba, they can not go home because they fear persecution by the Chinese government. There are thirteen of them now; four were <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/15/world/americas/15uighur.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released to Bermuda</a> in June. They wait, still at Guantanamo Bay, for the slow wheels of American justice to make one final revolution as their case heads to the Supreme Court.</p>

      <p>Probably about the time Judge Randolph was earning his law degree, Adel Noori was born in a far Western Chinese province called <a title="Wikipedia: Xinjiang" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xinjiang</a>. Xinjiang, which literally translated means &ldquo;new border,&rdquo; is home to most of the Muslim Uighur ethnic population, including Noori&rsquo;s wife and daughter. It is not home to Adel Noori however, because he is one of the men asking to be freed from Guantanamo Bay. Judge Randolph continues:</p>

      <blockquote><p>Sometime before September 11, 2001, petitioners left China and traveled to the Tora Bora mountains in Afghanistan, where they settled in a camp with other Uighurs. &hellip; Petitioners fled to Pakistan when U.S. aerial strikes destroyed the Tora Bora camp. &hellip; Eventually they were turned over to the U.S. Military, transferred to Guantanamo Bay and detained as &ldquo;enemy combatants.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Noori went to Kabul, Afghanistan before 9/11. In all likelihood, he was fleeing political persecution in China where, as an outspoken voice of political movements that run contrary to Chinese government policy, he was (and still is) wanted for &ldquo;<a href="#kiyemba_ii_sources">political crimes</a>.&rdquo; So Noori fled, and found himself in Afghanistan when the bombs started falling. As Judge Randolph explains, he then went to Pakistan seeking safety. And so, although their circumstances were dramatically different, Adel Noori and Jamal Kiyemba found themselves in Pakistan for the same reason. Their adopted country of Afghanistan was under attack as the United States sought retribution for an act of terrorism that neither men had anything to do with. Kiyemba and Noori became scapegoats. Like Kiyemba, Noori was handed over to US authorities in exchange for a monetary reward ($7000, <a href="#kiyemba_ii_sources">according to his lawyer</a>). And like Kiyemba, he was sent to Guantanamo.</p>
      <p>Noori and his compatriots didn&rsquo;t speak the same language as Kiyemba, and it is likely they never even met him. For five years, though, they shared a home, and waited for the bizarre and opaque organs of the US military, executive, and judicial systems to process them. After several years, it was clear to the US government that none of these men were threats to the United States, and that they ought to be released. Lawsuits filed on their behalf sought relief as early as 2005, and because of the similarity of their predicaments, they were consolidated under the <em>Kiyemba</em> umbrella. Thus, when Jamal Kiyemba was released in 2006 (to a country where he was not in danger of persecution), his namesake &ndash; <em>Kiyemba v. Bush</em> (later <em>Kiyemba v. Obama</em>) continued its progression through the legal system.</p>
      <p>But the Uighur men were stuck. The United States, trying to use 9/11 to justify a war in Iraq, was trading on Americans&rsquo; fears. Continued rhetoric about the &ldquo;<a href="#kiyemba_ii_sources">dangerous</a>&rdquo; men at Guantanamo was a political roadblock to releasing even the ones that were known to be innocent. Other countries, not unreasonably, rejected invitations to accept the men, arguing that if they were too dangerous for the US, we had no business trying to export them elsewhere. China, accused of using 9/11 to unjustly label the Uighur independence movement a terrorist organization, would have certainly imprisoned the men if they were released there. Their only true home, Afghanistan, remained a war zone. So they waited.</p>
      <p>Then, in 2008, they were freed. The DC District Court, seeing the impossible situation that the United States had created for the men, granted their petition for habeas corpus and directed their release into the United States. An earlier case, <em>Boumediene v. Bush</em> had already set the precedent for detainee habeas rights, and the court seemed to be acting in accordance with that decision. It was the closest thing to old-fashioned Constitutional justice since the war had begun. To many observers, it was a bit of fitting irony that the United States had created for itself a mechanism for importing people who never had any intention of immigration. As the Brennan Center for Justice <a href="#kiyemba_ii_sources">noted</a>:</p>

      <blockquote><p>They find themselves in their predicament not because they were seeking admission to the United States but because they were forcibly seized and brought to Guant&aacute;namo where they have been unlawfully detained for seven years. They are not seeking &ndash; nor did they ever seek &ndash; to immigrate; they are simply seeking release from their unlawful detention. And they seek that release into the United States because all other options are foreclosed to them.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Unfortunately that justice was short-lived, which brings us back to Judge Randolph. Speaking for the three-judge appellate panel, Randolph explained that no matter how unfair the United States may have been to these prisoners, the Writ of Habeas Corpus is not &ldquo;compensatory in nature&rdquo; and that such an unprecedented step as to compel non-citizens to be released onto US soil is entirely inappropriate. The Executive branch, he said, and not the courts, have sole discretion as to who gets to immigrate to the United States. He concluded, &ldquo;The government has represented that it is continuing diplomatic attempts to find an appropriate country willing to admit petitioners, and we have no reason to doubt that it is doing so. Nor do we have the power to require anything more.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Adel Noori has seen his share of new borders, but for now those borders remain the narrow boundaries of the Guantanamo prison. Meanwhile, the US government is exploring where the borders of its Executive and Judicial branch powers really are.</p>

In this multi-part story, I will examine the background of the case and some questions it raises.<br>
      </em></p>
      <h2>PART I: Jamal Kiyemba&rsquo;s long journey home</h2>
      <p>Jamal Kiyemba doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the case coming before the Supreme Court in 2010. He is a free man; he lives in Uganda, and as well as anyone might expect after what he went though, he is apparently leading a normal life there. But his full-circle journey, one that spanned four continents, is necessary prologue to the legal battle that wages on today under his name.</p>
      <p><span id="more-970"></span>Kiyemba wasn&rsquo;t your typical enemy combatant. Raised in a Roman Catholic family just outside of Uganda&rsquo;s capital city of Kampala, Kiyemba studied at Catholic schools until his late teens. In 1988, as future president and habeas petition respondent Barack Obama was visiting his father&rsquo;s hometown in Kenya, Kiyemba was probably studying at St. Mary&rsquo;s College in Kisubi in the country next door. The following year, Kiyemba&rsquo;s father died in a car accident, and a few years after that Kiyemba joined the rest of his family in London. He continued his studies at Catholic schools, ultimately attending university as a pharmacy student. But along with the opportunity that London offered, he also discovered other temptations that face college students. &ldquo;I loved partying, going out with girls and drinking,&rdquo; he told the Ugandan paper Sunday Vision in a <a href="#kiyemba_1_sources">2006 interview</a>, &ldquo;dividing my time between working and studying became increasingly difficult.&rdquo; Like so many of us did as young students, Kiyemba took a year off from university to find his way.</p>
      <p>What he found was Islam. Over the objections of his family, Kiyemba converted to Islam in 1999, renouncing his former lifestyle, religion, and education. He sought out a place where he could be with other Muslims and where he believed it would be &ldquo;easier to stay faithful to [his] religion.&rdquo; That place was supposed to be Afghanistan, but after the 9/11 attacks, Kiyemba opted instead for the relative safety of Pakistan, where he joined the Taliban, believing it would help him find solidarity with other Muslims. His plan was to locate a place to settle until the war was over; Afghanistan remained his ultimate goal. Safety was not to be found, however, and later in 2001 Pakistani officials, motivated perhaps by a $5000-per-person reward offered for any suspected Taliban member, captured Kiyemba and handed him over to US authorities. Within a year, Kiyemba was shackled and jailed at Guantanamo Bay where he would remain for the next four years.</p>
      <p>According to his <a href="#kiyemba_1_sources">2006 statements</a>, Kiyemba was repeatedly tortured at Guantanamo, witnessed the torture of others, and underwent hours of interrogation every day under grueling conditions. In 2005, he was part of a hunger strike protesting the conditions at Guantanamo. He says he eventually confessed to terrorist activities as a result of the torture and threats by the military guards.</p>
      <p>Kiyemba was ultimately released following a Department of Defense <a title="Administrative Review Board" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Review_Board" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Administrative Review Board</a> hearing in early 2006. The US had intended to return him to his country of residence, England, but he was denied entry there and he returned to Uganda in April 2006.</p>
      <p>In 2005, as Jamal Kiyemba sat shackled in his cell at Guantanamo, uncertain of whether he would be imprisoned for another day or for the rest of his life, his lawyer filed a <a href="#kiyemba_1_sources">petition for habeas corpus</a> challenging his detention as unlawful. The petition itself was only one among many filed on behalf of detainees at the military camp and in that context it is unimportant; Kiyemba was released pursuant to the 2006 ARB hearing and his legal standing evaporated. Because of some procedural detail of the American legal system, however, Jamal Kiyemba&rsquo;s name remains in the headlines of the highly public legal battle that began as <em>Kiyemba v. Bush</em> and which sits now on the desks of the nine justices of the Supreme Court of the United States under its new name: <em>Kiyemba v. Obama</em>.</p>
      <p><em><a href="/kiyemba-v-obama-part-ii-new-borders">Part II: &ldquo;New borders,&rdquo;</a> will look at the thirteen Chinese Uighur men who remain imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay and who carry on the Kiyemba legacy. With no viable options for deportation or repatriation, they await a US government separation-of-powers showdown that will determine their fate. </em></p>

        <p>A short exploration of the history, controversy,&nbsp;and possible future of China&rsquo;s dualistic written language. And the perspective of a student trying to balance an appreciation for culture with a desire to learn the language sometime in his lifetime.</p>
      </div>

      <p><br style="clear:both"></p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>Many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_character" target="_blank">centuries of history</a> form the foundation of logographic written Chinese. But it is only in the last sixty years that we have seen the bifurcation of that character system, and the debate that inevitably followed, when the Communist government in the late 1950s introduced what would be known as the set of <em>simplified characters</em>, officially eliminating the use of the previous character set (now known as <em>traditional characters</em>) in mainland (People&rsquo;s Republic of) China. Since many were opposed to this significant change, and because other Chinese-speaking entities continued using traditional characters, the debate over simplified versus traditional characters began immediately and continues today. Now, as modern technology and globalization wield ever more influence over an ancient culture, novel arguments lend further intrigue to an already fascinating political and linguistic question.</p>

      <p>First, for those unfamiliar with the bimodal Chinese writing system, here is a brief explanatory example. Below are the two ways to write the characters <em>fei ji</em> (airplane) in China&rsquo;s traditional and simplified character sets (sometimes incorrectly referred to as alphabets):</p>

      <img decoding="async" src="https://i.modjeska.us/images/feiji.png" class="post-center" alt="Feiji Characters" width="75%">

      <p>Chinese characters are categorized in part by the number of strokes they contain. As you can see, the characters on the left are much more complex: it takes 25 strokes to write &ldquo;airplane&rdquo; in traditional Chinese. The characters on the right are simplified characters, in which system only eight strokes are required to write the same word.</p>

      <p>The economy of strokes realized by moving from the traditional character set to the simplified has been often cited as a way to boost literacy, the primary argument in favor of using and maintaining the simplified character set since its inception. It is important to note that both character systems are equally capable of representing spoken Chinese and many texts are published in both systems in order to make them accessible to a broader audience.</p>

      <h2>A Resurgence of Interest</h2>

      <p>Although the simplified character set has been officially in use &mdash; in fact mandated by law &mdash; in mainland China for more than fifty years, other Chinese-speaking entities (principally Taiwan and Hong Kong) continue to use the traditional character set, and many feel that the traditional characters are superior for reasons to be explored presently. What appears to have inspired a renewed interest in this debate was the news in December 2008 that Taiwan was seeking world heritage status [<a href="#ref">1</a>] for the traditional character set. World Heritage status, pursuant to a 1972 UNESCO convention,&nbsp; means &ldquo;the identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage around the world considered to be of outstanding value to humanity&rdquo; [<a href="#ref">2</a>]. Approval of this request would put the Chinese traditional character set on the list with such notable items of cultural or natural significance as Australia&rsquo;s Great Barrier Reef, the Hiroshima Peace Memorial in Japan, and numerous state parks in the USA [<a href="#ref">3</a>]. The status would carry no official mandate to expand usage of traditional characters, and many speculate that it will not happen without China&rsquo;s support [<a href="#ref">4</a>]. But even as a symbolic measure Taiwan&rsquo;s move has sparked some <a href="http://www.chinasmack.com/stories/return-to-complex-characters-proposal-netizen-reactions/" target="_blank">interesting reactions</a> and opened the eyes of some (like me) who weren&rsquo;t previously aware of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate_on_traditional_and_simplified_Chinese_characters" target="_blank">vast opinion divide</a> on this subject.</p>

      <h2>Why Simplify?</h2>

      <p>Simplified characters were formally introduced in the 1950s and &rsquo;60s immediately prior to and during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_revolution" target="_blank">Cultural Revolution</a>, though their evolution dates back much earlier in the century [<a href="#ref">5</a>], and may have conceptual roots in Chinese calligraphy. The use of simplified characters in mainland China was, according to S. Robert Ramsey&rsquo;s <em>The Languages of China</em> [<a href="#ref">6</a>], made official policy pursuant to a speech and publication by Premier <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Enlai" target="_blank">Zhou Enlai</a> in 1958 [<a href="#ref">7</a>] and later formalized in a compendium of simplified characters published in 1964. According to most sources, the reason this policy was pursued was to increase literacy, the fairly obvious argument being that making characters easier to write would make reading and writing more accessible to all people. There is, if not a causal connection between literacy and character simplification, certainly evidence that the communist government has been immensely successful in increasing literacy since the cultural revolution [<a href="#ref">8</a>, <a href="#ref">9</a>, <a href="#ref">10</a>].</p>

      <h2>So, Out With the Old?</h2>

      <p>The counter-arguments to usage of the simplified character set largely fall into one of three broad categories: (1) simplification destroys or inhibits access to history and culture; (2) simplification diminishes aesthetics and expression; (3) the literacy argument for simplification is rendered moot by technology. There are other arguments against (and for) simplified characters, but most are either highly political or very subtle. Both of those categories are out of the scope of the general overview I am attempting to provide here, so I&rsquo;ll briefly expand a bit on each of the three arguments above and advise readers interested in the charged political debate or the finer points of the linguistic argument to explore other sources.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Simplification destroys or inhibits access to history and culture</em></strong>. This argument can take one of two forms. One is a generalized political argument alleging that Maoism sought to intentionally destroy all Chinese culture prior to the Cultural Revolution (see, for example, various works by <a href="http://www.cityu.edu.hk/ais/staff_kamyeelaw.htm" target="_blank">Dr. Kam-yee Law</a>). A more specific statement, and one that can be more readily understood and assessed by non-scholars of Chinese history, might simply state that before the 1950s texts in China were written in traditional characters, and therefore switching to a new character set must necessarily have as a consequence the inability of people educated within the new system to access those prior works.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Simplification diminishes aesthetics and expression</em></strong>. This argument can be applied both at the individual character level and the overall ability of the written language to &ldquo;[exploit] the full range and expression of the traditional Chinese characters&rdquo; [<a href="#ref">11</a>]. Chinese characters express meaning in part using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(Chinese_character)" target="_blank">radicals</a>. Simplified characters retain many of the core meaning radicals, but inevitably some were removed in the interest of reducing stroke count. Applied at a broader level, proponents of a return to the traditional character set argue that subtleties in expression, especially in historical works, are inaccessible even if the texts are converted to simplified characters.</p>

      <p><strong><em>Technology renders this argument moot</em></strong>. The newest and perhaps most compelling argument for a return to traditional characters is captured by James Fallows at the <em>Atlantic</em>. Fallows explains how technology, such as computers and mobile phone texting applications, are increasingly leveling the playing field for traditional and simplified characters because they are based on phonetic input rather than written strokes [<a href="#ref">12</a>]. I can illustrate this concept using the <em>airplane</em> example again: using my computer&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCIM" target="_blank">SCIM text input</a> (a program for inputting complex character-based languages) I can just as easily enter the simplified characters &#39134;&#26426; as I can the traditional characters &#39131;&#27231;. Why? Because in either case I type on my keyboard the letters &ldquo;fei ji&rdquo;, which are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin" target="_blank">pinyin</a> (phonetic) representation of the Chinese word. The difference in &ldquo;writing&rdquo; these words, then, is no longer 17 strokes of the pen, but a simple selection of the desired character input method in SCIM; that is, I click on &ldquo;Simplified&rdquo; or &ldquo;Traditional&rdquo; before I start typing. So all things input-related being equal, Fallows says, we might as well use the traditional characters for the reasons detailed above, and because in Chinese-speaking nations and communities outside of mainland China, that system is already in use.</p>

      <h2>A Student&rsquo;s Perspective</h2>

      <p>In the end, it&rsquo;s difficult for me &mdash; an American beginner in Chinese studies &mdash; to choose sides on this issue. A solid argument clearly can be made in favor or either system; conversely, a rationalization for either system is easily applied to whatever political viewpoint you have. For me it seems to be a question of whether to put a premium on cultural preservation or practical accessibility. In some ways, net appreciation for Chinese culture is probably increased by making it more accessible. Yet at some point a more thorough knowledge of China&rsquo;s expansive and rich history probably does require knowledge of the traditional character system.</p>

      <p>Fallows and others advancing the technology-fixes-everything approach overlook something that most students of Chinese can probably immediately recognize: you must be able to read Chinese in order to leverage any character input system (otherwise, how do you know if the character appearing on the screen is the right one?). You can&rsquo;t learn to read Chinese without memorizing the characters, and you can&rsquo;t memorize the characters without writing them many <em>many</em> times. If you&rsquo;re a student learning Chinese, the stroke count is often a good indicator of how many hours of practice it&rsquo;s going to take you to learn a particular character. So regardless of how sophisticated the technology, there will always be a learning curve and it will be much steeper for the traditional characters. Because of this reality, simplified characters were an easy choice for me as I went into Chinese 101. Now, the more solid my foundation in the language becomes, the more it becomes clear that an ability to read both systems would be of tremendous benefit.</p>
